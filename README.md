# Logbook
After trying out programs like Notion and Obsidian for note taking, I was unfortunatly left dissatisfied. They have the functionality to achieve what I'm looking for, but it would have been tedious to setup and maintain. All I need is a simple logbook and tasklist.

I've taking it upon myself to create this "perfect" but simple logbook. All critque is much appreciated.
